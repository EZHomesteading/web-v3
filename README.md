# EZHomesteading

- EZ Homesteading is a multivendor marketplace application with an emphasis on connecting family-scale farmers and gardeners with local consumers in their area.
- There are currently two roles on the site. A Co-Op, which can also be thought of as a vendor, is assigned a store upon signing up.
- Co-Ops can customize their store's appearance and functionality with a profile picture, a store banner, hours of operation, and much more.
- Co-Ops can list items for sale so long as they are homesteading, farmer's market, or self-sufficiency-related. This can be anything from homegrown tomatoes to homemade candles to water purification tablets.
- The other role on the site currently is a consumer, which as the name implies, are people who are interested in anything homesteading, farmer's market, or self-sufficiency-related. Consumers can search for items or browse through an assortment of categories.

### What Makes EZHomesteading Different?

Farmer's markets frequently charge vendors up front for their space. These vendors are outside watching over their items for up to 10 hours to sell their produce, hoping consumers will come looking for what they offer. EZHomesteading provides an easier, faster, and commitment-free way for these vendors to sell their fresh organic produce by connecting them with consumers in their area. EZHomesteading manages logistics and marketing for co-ops and producers. Producers are people with small gardens, a few cows, an apple tree, etc. These individuals do not have the time or desire to sell smaller quantities of their produce to consumers. By becoming EZH producers, these individuals can sell their excess produce in bulk to co-ops in their area.
