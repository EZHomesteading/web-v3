      explanation="The EZHomesteading Organic rating, which is visible from the market, store, and listings pages, represents the methods of a seller's growing and harvesting.  EZHomesteading anonymously & arbitrarily purchases produce from both EZH Co-ops & Producers to test and verify the legitimacy of their certification and to maintain our commitment to fresh, local, & organic produce. Everytime a seller creates a listing for anything edible, they select all the qualities of growing that apply to said produce."
